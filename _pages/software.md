I like coding :-) and I was lucky enough to find a lot of opportunities to join my research activities with programming tasks.
I have been involved in various scientific projects which included the development of - mostly - open-source programs.

# J-PET Framework

{% include gallery %}

[Github repository of the Framework](https://github.com/JPETTomography/j-pet-framework)


I was the initiator and for years the leader of the team that has been developing an open-source data analysis software platform  
for the [J-PET](http://koza.if.uj.edu.pl/pet/) project, in the frame of which we built a novel positron emission tomography scanner that turned out to be a perfect tool for
precise physics tests of the fundamental properties of various particles.

The latest article describing the J-PET Framework can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711020300509?via%3Dihub)
One can find the list of publications [here](http://koza.if.uj.edu.pl/publications/pet), including our recent Nature Communication [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25905-9).

J-PET Framework provides a common environment for implementation of reconstruction, calibration and filtering procedures, as well as for user-level analyses of Positron Emission Tomography data. 
The library contains a set of building blocks that can be combined by users with even little programming experience, into chains of processing tasks through a simple API.
The J-PET environment can be used to e.g. develop a reconstruction chain for the real data collected by a PET scanner or to implement a calibration procedure, an image reconstruction method, or any kind of a multi-step analysis. Other typical applications consist of comparative studies of prototype PET scanners performance based on the Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.
The Framework software platform is currently used by scientists from the Jagiellonian University in Krak√≥w, National Centre for Nuclear Research in Warsaw and INFN Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati and has been successfully deployed on different scales starting from laptops and personal PC-s, through mid-size computing clusters to HPC Swierk cluster.
Currently, use cases of the J-PET Framework span among various data analyses and imaging application of the first J-PET device. Virtually, any studies involving data analysis are based on the
J-PET Framework.

# DIRAC
In the frame of the LHCb project, I participated in the development and implementation of the Message Queue architecture (RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ) and the development of the so-called Pilot Loggers as a part of the [DIRAC](https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC) middleware.
DIRAC is an interware, meaning a software framework for distributed computing.
DIRAC provides a complete solution to one or more user communities requiring access to distributed resources. DIRAC builds a layer between the users and the resources offering a common interface to a number of heterogeneous providers, integrating them in a seamless manner, providing interoperability, at the same time as an optimized, transparent and reliable usage of the resources.
I am on the list of the main contributors to DIRAC code [link](https://github.com/DIRACGrid/DIRAC/blob/integration/AUTHORS.rst)
