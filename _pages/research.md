Fundamental Physics
---
My interests are focused on experimental testing of discrete symmetries  ([LHCb](https://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/), [J-PET](http://koza.if.uj.edu.pl/pet/), and [KLOE-2](http://w3.lnf.infn.it/research/particle-physics/kloe-2/?lang=en)), and formerly on the search for a new kind of matter, the so-called mesic-nuclei (WASA project). Those topics are related to fundamental questions in modern physics e.g. the asymmetry of matter over antimatter, the basics of quantum mechanics (quantum oscillations, entanglement, and decoherence phenomena), the validity of the fundamental CPT and Lorentz symmetries, and the existence of a new kind of matter.

* Search for discrete symmetry violations 
* Mirror matter searches - see [here](https://mirrormirrorinpbsm.wordpress.com/) and our first proposal [Feasibility of ortho-positronium lifetime studies with the J-PET detector in context of mirror matter models](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.10589)
* Quantum Entanglement

I am the NCBJ coordinator of the
National Supercomputing Infrastructure for [EuroHPC PL](https://www.ncbj.gov.pl/en/aktualne/eurohpc-pl-national-supercomputing-infrastructure-eurohpc) project.

Positron Emission Tomography

My current PET-related work consists of the coordination of the J-PET Total Body Software group,
responsible for the preparation of medical data processing and image
reconstruction software for the next generation of cost-effective
total-body PET tomography scanners. This involves software development [tools](https://github.com/JPETTomography) including image reconstruction algorithms, Monte Carlo simulations, and applications of the machine learning methods to PET tomography. In the past, I was coordinating the development of data analysis [framework](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711020300509). I am a member of the OpenGate steering committee since 2019. We are especially focused on the assessment of the total-body scanners and on the development of novel PET methods ,e.g. positronium tomography, using GATE.

* Image reconstruction algorithms for total-body PET scanners
* image corrections 
* multi-photon (e.g. 2+1) PET tomography 
* application of Machine Learning methods for PET tomography

Other projects:
---
* Application of Convolutional Neural Networks for LHCb electromagnetic calorimeter  
* Search for eta mesic nuclei (WASA). It was a topic of my PhD thesis realized partly in Forschungszentrum Juelich, Germany and of my first post-doc:  [article](https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.87.035204) based on my Phd thesis. Another [article](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375947417300064) based on the analysis done together with Magdalena Skurzok. Other articles about the same topic can be found [here](http://koza.if.uj.edu.pl/publications/wasa-at-cosy).
