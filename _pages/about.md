## Who am I?
I am an assistant professor at the National Centre for Nuclear
Research ([NCBJ](https://www.ncbj.gov.pl/en)), Warsaw, Poland. 
Experimental physicist with a telecommunication engineering background
and extensive expertise in software development, Monte Carlo
simulations, data analysis, machine learning applications, and experience in leading
scientific projects. Member of the [LHCb](https://lhcb-outreach.web.cern.ch/) collaboration at CERN and 
the [OpenGate](http://opengatecollaboration.org/) steering committee.

My main interests are focused on novel imaging algorithms, machine learning techniques for noise reduction, and scientific software development. 
Last but not least, I am a curious physicist who wants to
understand the rules governing the quantum world, engaged in (too many
;-))  fundamental research including tests of discrete symmetries and quantum entanglement. 

From 2011 to 2024 I was a member of the [J-PET](http://koza.if.uj.edu.pl/pet/) collaboration.
I led the Total Body Software Group,
responsible for preparing  medical data processing and image
reconstruction software for the next generation of cost-effective
total-body polymer PET tomography scanners. 
Earlier, I was responsible for the development of the J-PET Analysis Framework.
I also participated in several fundamental physics analyses, including quantum correlation studies
and mirror matter searches.

Between 2021 and 2023 I served as the NCBJ coordinator of the
National Supercomputing Infrastructure for the [EuroHPC PL](https://www.ncbj.gov.pl/en/projekt/eurohpc-pl-national-supercomputing-infrastructure-eurohpc) project.

Prior, I contributed to the incorporation of the the Message Queue architecture as a part of the [DIRAC](https://dirac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) interware.
Earlier in my career, I was involved in the [KLOE-2](http://w3.lnf.infn.it/research/particle-physics/kloe-2/?lang=en), WASA-at-COSY and COSY-11 collaborations.

I am fluent in English, French, Spanish and Polish.
I hold an MSc in Telecommunications from [AGH](https://www.agh.edu.pl/en/) University of Science and Technology, as well as an MSc and PhD in Physics from [Jagiellonian University](https://en.uj.edu.pl/en_GB/start), Poland.
